#### **2A. S.E.S.H. Glove**

*Wearable Haptic Interface for VR/AR*

**The Story (2-3 sentences):** Pioneered a novel method of using vacuum-based layer jammers as actuators for VR haptic feedback. First-author IEEE Haptics 2024 publication. Built the entire glove system—mechanical design, fabrication, Arduino integration, Unity environment.

**Key Stats:**

* 4N blocking force  
* 28:1 transparency ratio (jammed vs. unjammed)  
* \<$0.20 per jammer, \<10 min fabrication time  
* Validated against Euler-Bernoulli beam theory

**Visuals Needed:**

* Demo video embed (you have this)  
* Animated diagram: layer jamming physics (vacuum on/off → sheets lock/slide)  
* Photo of glove with callouts  
* Graph: Force vs. sheet count (from your paper, Fig 8A)

**Links:**

* IEEE Paper  
* YouTube demo

#### **2B. BeatRite**

*Wearable Heart Failure Prediction Device*

**The Story:** Lead engineer for pre-seed medical device startup. Translating clinical research into a functional multi-sensor wearable integrating PPG, ECG, temperature, and IMU. Architecting the full pipeline from raw biosignals to iOS app.

**Key Stats:**

* Pan-Tompkins algorithm for real-time R-peak detection  
* Multi-sensor fusion (ECG, PPG, IR, IMU, temp)  
* Hardware → Mobile data pipeline

**Visuals Needed (all created, no photos):**

* System architecture diagram (sensors → Arduino Giga → signal processing → BLE → iOS)  
* Animated ECG waveform with R-peak detection highlighting  
* Sensor fusion concept diagram (abstract, showing data streams merging)

**Note:** Hardware images classified—visuals will be explanatory diagrams only.
